# `RanTool2`: A tool to measure the ability to produce random series

This script is based on the [RanTool](https://github.com/MikoBie/ranTool) -- a _python_ based script to conduct simple experiments on human-generated randomness. The current iteration is specifically designed to be run on [Pavlovia](https://pavlovia.org). Therefore, it is no longer a _python_ script but rather _java script_ (a very naive to be precise). Neverthenless, it allows for gathering basic demographic data like sex and age. Furthermore, it has possibility to integrate with Profilic. The project was supported by funds from the Polish National Science Center (project no. 2019/35/N/HS6/04318).
